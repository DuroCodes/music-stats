# music stats

get your last.fm music stats in a nice image:

![example](demo.png)

uses [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) for image manipulation and [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) for music data

made with (very bad) [gleam](https://gleam.run/)

probably going to rewrite it in [go](https://go.dev/) or [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) soon
